# Vault-Encryption-System
This is an application project built using Java in Android Studio that enables merchants and customers to post their card details securely. 
The sensitive card details are encrypted and decrypted using AES algorithm while the passwords are encrypted using SHA256 algorithm. 
I used SQLite to store the database of the application as it was easy to handle. I also had help from the following friends while designing 
this project: Gloria, Saxiben and Angila.

## 1. First set up the project as follows:
Dowload and install Android Studio
#
Download the zipped folder and unzip it OR clone the repository to your local machine
#
Open the project from within Android Studio

## 2. Run the project on either the VM or through an Android phone once the project loads

## 3. Interact with the user interface and view the database afterwards to see the encryption
